                      <p class="m-4">"Samuel was fantastic! He arrived at 7am and was finished tiling our bathroom by 12:30. Incredibly fast, thorough, clean and professional. The tiles look really great. And he is a very nice man too, friendly but gets on with the job. I would not hesitate to employ him again or recommend him to anyone. Thank you Samuel so much for your hard work, we really appreciate it. ~ Lisa + Sam."</p>
