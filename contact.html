                      <p class="m-4">"I have had Lots of mixed experiences from my builder. However, Samuel was a diamond in the rough! Just an honest, highly skilled and hardworking family man. Turned up bang on time, did the work to a high standard, tidied up and left before I could even blink an eye. He wasn’t the cheapest quote but I have learnt through my builder not to take the cheapest - buy cheap buy twice.We had bought some expensive tiles so was very keen that they were laid perfectly and Samuel did not disappoint. Will now be our tiler for every job."</p>

I left the work with him and he did all no disturbs or lost of the question to me. He supposes to complete the job in one day even others asking 2 days to complete and unbelievable he did it just above a half-day with perfectly neat while handling very thick garage tiles than normal tiles. A highly responsive person among all the tilers I contacted. I have no doubt to recommend him for others. He is the best one for your job."</p>

                      <p class="m-4 ">"Samuel is simply brilliant. Previous guy started the job...screeded floor really badly - then did a runner while I was out…! Anyway, Samuel came to my rescue the very next day and did a simply stunning job and managed to make good all of the bad work done previously (it was more than a challenge). He also kept to his word and returned the following day (a Sunday) to complete the job even though he had definitely come down with a very bad cold overnight. As per other reviews, Samuel works at lightning speed, is dependable, tidy and a very nice guy indeed. He's not a ‘jack of all trades’ and this is evident in his work – a Master Tiler if there is such a thing. I would not hesitate to hire him again and can't recommend him highly enough. Hire him; you will be glad you did. Overall A+++++ Rating from me"</p>
